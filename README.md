# My_Bloomberg_Lite



## Description/Background

The Bloomberg_Lite is a mock version of the actual Bloomberg terminal. It would allow the user to enter a ticker and get a graph showing the stock price since inception and also provide news articles and reddit posts from the internet. This would allow users to explore key factors and important ratios that can influence their buying and selling decisions. It would also have very similar styling to how the actual bloomberg terminals look like.

Functionality & MVPs:
In MyBloomberg Lite, users will be able to:

- Search for stocks and view detailed information about each stock.
- Display real-time stock prices and historical price charts.
- Compare multiple stocks and analyze their performance side by side.
- Have the option to filter the graph of the stock price
- Be able to hover over the graph of the stock price and see the extra details of the stock price.

In addition, this project will include:

- A README with instructions showing how to use this project
- If I have time would like to add news articles and reddit posts from the internet relating the ticker/comapny
- I would also like to add sector information and provide daily information about the sector performance

Technologies, Libraries, APIs:
We plan to use the following technologies, libraries, and APIs:

- D3.js for creating interactive and visually appealing stock price charts.
- Alpha Vantage API for retrieving real-time and historical stock data.
- As a backup I will be using Realtime Stock Data API
- If I have the time would like to  use reddit API and News API
